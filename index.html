<p>You need a voice when it counts to ensure that your property and the island of Rakino can continue to be enjoyed to the full by generations to come. </p> 

<p>Communication with members is generally via email. Regular e-Newsletters from the Committee are published to keep everyone abreast of what's happening on the island. There’s also a traditional outbreak of highly competitive family-oriented activities over the Christmas holiday period, which the Association proactively supports and promotes… We’d always like to do more, with your support!</p>

<p>You can join RRA at any point in the year by completing a <a href="/register/">membership form</a> and returning it to the Secretary with payment.  RRA’s financial year runs from July 1st to June 30th, with an AGM in October over Labour Weekend.</p>
